## OVERVIEW
OpenCV is an open source Computer Vision and machine learning libarary. It provides the implementation of more than 2500 optimized algorithms.
It has state of the art and classic implementations of algorithms used to recognise faces, track moving objects, identify objects, video processing 
capabilities etc. 

It is available in four interfaces as of now, 

1. C++
2. Python
3. Java
4. MATLAB

OpenCV currently supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS.
It is mostly used in real-time vision applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when available. 
A full-featured CUDAand OpenCL interfaces are being actively developed right now and 
there are over 500 algorithms and about 10 times as many functions that compose or support those algorithms. 
OpenCV is written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works seamlessly with STL containers.
